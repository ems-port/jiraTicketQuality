I will assist you shortly. ~A:We’ve checked your details and found that your bike was taken outside the 10 km allowed zone, which is why a £25 penalty has been applied to your rental. ~A:Please make sure in the future to stay within the 10 km zone from your hub. When bikes are taken outside this zone and break down or get stuck, our recovery team has to travel extra distance, which increases operational costs. ~A:We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in keeping the service fair for everyone. ~C:Sir I am doing delivery ~C:How it's possible to me in 10 km radius ~A:I completely understand, sir we know riders often travel longer distances during deliveries.\n\nHowever, our bikes are designed for use within a 10 km radius from the hub to ensure proper GPS connection, battery support, and recovery coverage if any issue occurs.\n\nIf you go beyond this range, the system automatically flags it and applies a penalty because recovery and maintenance become difficult outside the service zone.\n\nWe recommend planning your deliveries within the allowed area to avoid such charges in the future. ~A:To use our services again, you’ll need to pay the pending amount.

Please be aware that if the bike is not recovered and is deemed lost or stolen, a penalty of £2,500 may apply, as outlined in our terms of service.\n\nWe strongly urge you to make every effort to recover the bike. Our system shows that your rental is still active, and rentals cannot end on their own without the bike being properly returned. ~C:Yes, the session is back on my app. The bike is still at the original location.

We also ask that you file a police report for the stolen bike and share the Crime Reference Number with us once it's available. ~C:I remember seeing a message that there will be maintenance today until 8:30pm and I think this why the system is so buggy today, therefore it is not my fault that the bike hadn't locked. ~A:It’s possible that the bike wasn’t locked properly. This can occasionally happen if the bike is locked in a hurry or under certain conditions. We recommend double-checking to ensure the lock was securely engaged. ~A:Please note that, as per our terms, the responsibility for the bike remains with you during the rental period.\n\nI understand you mentioned attempting to lock the bike and suspecting that it may not have locked properly due to possible system issues. While there was a scheduled maintenance earlier today, it was completed as planned, and we haven’t received any similar reports of app or locking issues from other customers since then. This suggests the app should now be functioning normally.\n\nSince the tracker continues to show the same location and you’ve already checked the area twice without success, the next step is to file a police report for the missing bike. Once you’ve done so, please share the Crime Reference Number with us so we can record it on your account and assist further. ~C:SP-171455-25-0101-00 ~C:[image file] ~C:[^FormSubmission-report-stolen-property-formsp-171455-25-0101-00.pdf] _(46 kB)_ ~C:This is the attached police report ~C:I reported to the police just now ~A:Thank you for sharing the police report and Crime Reference Number, we really appreciate you taking swift action on this.\n\nWe'll keep this chat open and will now review the case internally with our recovery and operations teams.

Thank you for waiting — I’ll update you shortly. ~A:[~accountid:62bc40e3d8658e0d49198b8a] The rental has been finished, but the app is still showing the previous rental. ~C:So what am I meant to do ~C:Just wait around? ~C:This service is ridiculous ~A:Please reboot your phone and completely close the app, then reopen it and let me know. ~C:No help ~A:Could you please confirm whether you have deleted and reinstalled the app? ~C:Listen, if you guys don’t fix this problem I’m going to need some sort of money back.

Please rest assured that we take your concern seriously and want to make things right. ~C:Make things right by sorting out the issue and compensating me for this because right now I’m losing money and losing time because of your System ~A:Could you please try deleting the app once and reinstalling it to see if that resolves the issue? ~C:You keep asking me to do these pointless things. It doesn’t help at all. I’m just a user. You need to sort it out from your end your system do you understand? ~A:Kindly delete the app and reinstall it. Once done, please share a screenshot of your app screen so we can check it for you. ~C:Nothing you’re asking me to do is resolving my issue. I’ve had this problem multiple times and complained every single time you guys haven’t done anything to sort the issue out. Therefore the customer complains are fallen on deaf ears as I said to you I will be needing some sort of compensation for this because I’ve complained three times And nothing has been done about it and now it’s happened again. And I’m losing money and time from a problem that is out of my hands and on your behalf ~C:You keep telling me to delete the app reinstall it why are you not understanding?

Please hang on just a little longer, and I’ll make sure your issue is addressed promptly. ~A:[~accountid:712020:8f5c3870-9bb6-4299-922f-e6f38426666b] Hi, I can’t see any obvious issues with the previous rental finish or anything with the customer’s account. \nI have provided a daily pass compenssation, I will need to check this out with software team as I can’t fix it right away. \n\nSo the customer still might see the issue with the app for some time 😢 ~A:[~accountid:712020:7cf03fa9-630e-4c51-976d-4cd5fc13b697] The customer’s rental has already been finished, but the app is still showing the previous bike ID and rental ID. We have provided the troubleshooting guide to the customer, yet they are still facing the same issue. ~C:Listen I’m on 4% I don’t have all day for this you guys are being an inconvenience to my day I’ll be needing a refund for the day or something because this is unacceptable ~A:We’ve checked your account and don’t see any issues with your previous rental. As a gesture, we’ve provided you with a daily pass compensation. ~A:Please note that the app issue might still appear for some time, as we need to coordinate with our software team to fully resolve it. We appreciate your patience while we work on this. ~A:Thank you for your understanding. ~A:Please confirm after finishing all rentals, does this interface show up on your app? ~C:You’ve checked my account and don’t see any issues with my previous rental. Your systems are messed up as it is anyway anyways so we can’t go with what you’re seeing on your system because your system tells You that my bike is locked right now when in reality I’m looking at it saying unlocked so your systems aren’t correct and their malfunction and clearly right now so please don’t tell me that you can see everything’s okay cause that’s  absolute nonsense ~C:So what you’re trying to tell me is I cannot use the service for the rest of the day because your system is now playing up ~A:Thank you for explaining the situation, and I completely understand your frustration. I’m very sorry for the confusion caused by the discrepancy between what our system shows and the actual status of your bike. ~A:Please rest assured that we are escalating this issue to our technical team to investigate and fix the system error. We appreciate your patience while we work to resolve this and will keep you updated on the progress. ~A:As a gesture, we’ve provided you with a daily pass compensation. ~A:Is there anything else I can assist you with? ~C:So fix the issue ~A:Please confirm after finishing all rentals, does this interface show up on your app? ~A:[~accountid:62bc40e3d8658e0d49198b8a] [~accountid:712020:7cf03fa9-630e-4c51-976d-4cd5fc13b697] Now that the customer has started their rental and received the compensation, it seems that the customer might be causing their app to freeze intentionally. The customer has been putting pressure on chat support, and it appears they might be trying to exploit the system. ~A:We have checked your details, and you have started your rental. Could you please confirm how your app issue was resolved and how you started your rental? ~A:[~accountid:712020:7cf03fa9-630e-4c51-976d-4cd5fc13b697] crap, sometimes I’m in awe how creative they can get. \nI have asked our software team to have a look at it - they might see something more and confirm if this was a real issue or customer faking it. ~A:[~accountid:62bc40e3d8658e0d49198b8a] [~accountid:712020:7cf03fa9-630e-4c51-976d-4cd5fc13b697] These two screenshots are different  one is from an iPhone and the other from a 2-second Android phone. Logging into the app on these two phones is causing the app to get stuck.\n\n[image file]\n\n\n\n[image file] ~A:​We haven't heard back from you, so we are closing this chat now.

Please note that this penalty cannot be waived. ~A:Please leave the bike in a safe and accessible location. Our recovery team will retrieve it from there. Once you have paid the penalty, you will be able to take a new bike from the hub. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. ~C:It's not a policy ~C:Fare policy ~A:This is the second time you have exceeded the rental time limit. On this occasion, your rental lasted 13 hours, which is 1 hour over the allowed limit of 12 hours. Please note that our policy applies equally to all customers, whether new or returning, to ensure fairness and equality for everyone. ~C:My bike has still good charged. So it should not be returned within the time period. If I exceed the time, it will not damage the bike. ~A:When you begin your rental, the time limit is clearly displayed on your app screen. ~C:All other bike companies around the London allow customers to take bike over month ~C:We don't know what policy you are making for your regular customer ~C:Bad policy ever ~A:However, when the rental time limit is exceeded, the system automatically ends the rental, and we are unable to unlock the bike ourselves. As a result, we have to recover the bike by loading it onto a truck, which increases our operational costs. Additionally, during this time, the bike is not available at the hub, which affects overall bike availability. Thank you for your understanding. ~C:You should look at the charge of the bike ~C:My bike is good charged. Why I need to go back hub. I am paying £50 for a week. ~A:Please note that by purchasing a subscription, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions. It is entirely up to the customer to decide whether or not they wish to purchase a subscription. ~C:Please change your policy that avail for customers ~C:Not you only ~C:Money making can not be your policy ~C:Today I am sick at morning ~C:Feeling not well to go out ~C:In the meantime you take the advantage. Shame on ! ~A:No sir, the policy is in place to ensure that every customer is required to return the bike to the hub. This helps reduce bike unavailability at the hub and prevents unfairness among customers. Therefore, we must apply the penalty to discourage repeated violations and to encourage customers to return the bike to the hub on time in the future. Thank you for your understanding. ~C:Be customer orientated. ~C:Otherwise one day you will go out from market ~A:We hope you feel better soon and wish you a speedy recovery. However, please understand that we have no way of knowing about your illness unless you inform us in advance. Since your rental period has already been exceeded and you are contacting us after the fact, we are unable to waive the penalty. To avoid such situations in the future, please contact us at least 12 hours before your rental period ends so we can take the necessary steps. Thank you for your understanding. ~C:Why unavailability here. Because I am giving you £50 a week. I have a right to get bike 24/7 ~C:No one in this earth can not say I will be good health after one minute ~C:So how I will let you know before 12 hours ~A:Yes, but my point is directed at customers who do not return the bike to the hub on time. Their actions cause this problem. Would you be happy if a bike was unavailable because someone else failed to return it to the hub? ~C:You can  be sick within a minute ~A:If you are not feeling well, please contact us immediately. ~C:Listen I am giving you £50 on what basis? ~C:You are taking my money to give a bike for whole week ~C:Isn't it? ~C:If I am right. why I will consider unavailability for others ~C:Listen make policy customer orientated ~C:This is service based business ~A:Our service does not allow you to keep a single bike for an entire week. Each bike has a 12-hour rental time limit, so you must return the bike within 12 hours, even if you have a weekly subscription. Having a weekly subscription means you can rent bikes throughout the week, but you are still required to return each bike within the 12-hour limit. You cannot keep one bike for 7 days straight. ~C:After going out to hub, customer can be sick . So this moment how he will return your hub. ~C:Before charging you should talk with me discuss the situation. Then come up a final decision ~A:If you are not feeling well, you must contact us so that we can assist you and take the necessary steps. ~A:Please note that the rental policy is clearly displayed on your app screen, so there should be no confusion regarding the rules. If the bike is rented under your account, it is your responsibility to contact us if you encounter any issues. Additionally, we send notifications to all customers as reminders to return the bike to the hub if the rental time limit is exceeded. Therefore, penalties are applied according to policy and cannot be waived. ~C:Listen, not only me all other customers are facing this difficulties. So port authority should think carefully ~C:Because we customers are matters ~C:Most of the port customers in London are students ~A:Yes, we are fully aware, but it is the customer’s responsibility to return the bike to the hub. All customers agree to the terms and conditions, which include the rental policy, when they use our service. We are not imposing penalties arbitrarily; they are applied according to the agreed-upon policy. ~A:Is there anything else I can assist you with? ~C:Listen, today I was in hospital for my sickness. And coming back I am looking penalty Fare has been charged. How cruelty! ~A:Please note that you should contact us immediately if you encounter any issues. In this case, your rental was force-finished, and you only reached out to us afterward, which is not appropriate. Do you have any medical report or supporting documents to validate your claim? ~C:Yes I have ~A:Please share with us. ~C:[^[video file]] _(17.17 MB)_ ~C:Hello ~A:Thanks for the document let me review it for you. ~A:Is there any medical report or supporting document related to yourself that simplifies the medicines? ~C:I have some health issues from long period of time such diabetes, high blood pressure, hush cholesterol.
